# F7 README

This will guide you with running the game if the .exe doesn't work.

## Systems

This 100% works on Windows, but I have no idea about how it'll run on OSX or Linux.\
This guide is meant for Windows. 

## Download Python

Get Python from this link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

OR

Open the Command Prompt (the next step in this README),\
and type "python", which should lead you to a Microsoft Store page to download Python. (I think this method works better.)

## Opening The Command Prompt

Open the folder where the game is. This folder should be called "F7_game", \
unless you renamed it. In the top bar of the file explorer that tells you the folder's location\
(shown in this image: https://gyazo.com/d66c98e04f5ff02937dd8f5f3147cd99),
type in 
```
cmd
```
The blank command prompt should open now.

## Downloading The Necessary Libraries

You need to download 2 libraries before the game can run, so in the Command Prompt, type
```
pip install colored
```
and
```
pip install playsound
```
Those should be the libraries required.

## Running The Game

In the command prompt, type in 
```
python main.py
```
This should lead to the game starting.
